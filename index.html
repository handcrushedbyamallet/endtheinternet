Twelve years ago I started this company on just a dollar and a small 
settlement from starbucks coffee. Since then it has grown like a basketball 
player, encompassing the globe like a giant wet basketball. A basketball 
that is heating up everyday.

We live in a harsh world, a world where water is stored in plastic shells, 
as lakes stand by untouched, unappreciated, undrunk. A world where we kill 
animals only to make them into smaller stuffed toy versions of the same 
animal. Here at EndTheInternet we abide by the laws of nature and not man. 
By saving usable products that would otherwise have been dumped into 
landfills, the ocean, or depop, we are saving both lives and money. 
Down-cycling is art, and as Picasso said art is truth and the truth is that 
downcycling is art and art is truth and the truth is that down-cycling is 
art and art is truth and the truth is that down-cycling is art and art is 
truth and the truth is that down-cycling is art and art is truth and the 
truth is that down-cycling is art and art is truth and the truth is that 
down-cycling is art and art is truth and the truth is that down-cycling is 
art and art is truth and the truth is that down-cycling is art and art is 
truth and the truth is that down-cycling is art and art is truth and the 
truth is that down-cycling is art and art is truth and the truth is that 
down-cycling is art and art is truth and the truth is that down-cycling is 
art.
